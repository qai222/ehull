Inconsistent `e_above_hull`
--

This notebook shows some values of `e_above_hull` from `Materials Project` appear to be different 
from the ones computed using `get_decomp_and_e_above_hull`. The latter should be preferred. 

You would need `pymatgen` to run the notebook. 
The code only looked at one chemical system, but it can be extended to others.
